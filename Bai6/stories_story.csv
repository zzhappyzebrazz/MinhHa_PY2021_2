1,The Stellar One,Daniel Errico,https://youtu.be/lCdtSo4IV7M,"<p>When the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks. One of these rocks was a bit more special than the rest. She was unlike any that came before her. She was a kind and happy rock, who always floated near a big blue planet. Sometimes when the light hit her surface, she would glow a brilliant green. At times like those, she almost didn&#39;t look like a rock at all. As the sky moved from day to day, and week to week, the rock would see planets far off in the distance. She would wonder what it would be like to go to them. Week after week and month after month she would wonder. Until one day she decided to go find out. The rock had never gone anywhere before and wasn&#39;t sure how to go about it. She started to rock back and forth. Then she started to spin. Soon enough, she was flying through the sky. As she left, clouds swirled on the big blue planet. For it was sad to see her go, and when planets cry there is a rain storm. At first the rock was not good at moving. She would spin too far to the right or too far to the left. Slowly she learned how to travel whichever direction she liked, and she enjoyed exploring space. She saw a planet filled with water, with not a speck of land. Then found a planet all dried up, with beaches made of sand. She swore she met a planet who looked suspiciously like her. And then she saw a planet that was, well&hellip; she wasn&rsquo;t sure. One planet she discovered, had grown forests made of green. Another one was very shy, not fond of being seen. She flew right by a planet, that was frozen icy cold. And then she saw a planet that was made of jewels and gold! She had started to notice that each planet seemed brighter than the last. They were all so different and all so pretty. It became hard for her to decide where to go next. If each planet she visited was more beautiful than the one before it, then how could she decide which way to go next, and how could she decide where to stay. So she continued traveling, afraid to miss a single planet. Eventually she came upon the big blue planet that she had once circled, but she found that is was not the same. It was shining in a way that it never had before. It was more blue than it had ever been, and certainly more beautiful. This made her stop for a moment. &ldquo;I do not know where I should go next&rdquo; she said out loud. &ldquo;Each direction is filled with wonderful planets. And I cannot stop, knowing that the next planet will be even more beautiful if I continue on. Even my big blue planet has grown more beautiful every day in my absence.&rdquo; The big blue planet overheard this. &ldquo;Can you not see why I am brighter?&quot; it asked. &quot;You are the brightest planet I have ever seen,&quot; she said, &quot;but I do not know why you glow brighter today than you did when I left you.&quot; &ldquo;You have brightened me,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;But I am just a rock&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You are no longer just a rock like the day you left me,&rdquo; said the big blue planet. &ldquo;You have grown bold and bright. Now you are a shooting star, and you are the reason that I shine. And while you are worrying about which direction to go, all of the planets in space are hoping that you will come their way to brighten them.&rdquo; And so the shooting star, who was no longer just a rock, finally understood. It did not matter where she went, the light was her own. So the rock sat there for a moment, by the bright blue planet and wondered. &quot;Should I keep traveling, or should I fly around the big blue planet and grow brighter with it each day.&rdquo; She thought, until she knew exactly what to do.</p>",1,stories/images/the_stellar_one.png,"When the universe was young the sky was filled with planets, and stars, and stardust, and many many rocks.

2,Gemma,Daniel Errico & Art by Shivani Kaushik,https://www.freechildrenstories.com/gemma,"<p>1. GOLDEN Gemma was only five minutes away from her parents&rsquo; hut, but the jungle had already taken on a different personality. It was thicker. The trees had grown taller. The ti plants shaded the green forest a sinister red. There was no doubt about it- the jungle was more dangerous here, and Gemma loved it. As a baby, Gemma&rsquo;s parents had taken her on their expeditions over mountains, deserts, and vast seas. It was exciting, unpredictable, and deeply irresponsible. Now that they had settled down in the tropical rainforest, Gemma had to devise intricate plans just to sneak out for morning adventures. This particular plan hinged on the help of Milo, her ring-tailed lemur. Years of mischief, tom-foolery, and Gemma&rsquo;s influence had helped Milo develop skills that other lemurs would give theirs rings to have themselves, were such a transaction to be made possible. And on this morning, Milo was lying in Gemma&rsquo;s bed, wearing a wig made of straw, the same sandy blonde color as Gemma&rsquo;s hair, snoring loudly. In a stroke of genius, they had even braided it into pigtails to match her style. They tried adding a pair of her old glasses but those kept sliding down his face, given that she had a human-sized head, and his was irreparably lemur-sized. &ldquo;I swear, her snoring is getting worse and worse,&rdquo; said Gemma&rsquo;s dad from the breakfast table, sipping on a warm tea. Gemma&rsquo;s mom raised an eyebrow from across her book. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t even sound human!&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re exaggerating a little, don&rsquo;t you think, dear?&rdquo; Gemma&rsquo;s mom said. But he was not. And had either of them walked one room over to check on their daughter, they may have shouted, and woken up a little, groggy primate with straw pigtails. A short walk away, Gemma brushed past a prickly bush and followed a small break in the twisted liana vines. She came to a wall of leaves and grew excited at the sound of movement ahead. She often felt like she could sense when adventure was near. In fact, she felt it almost every single day, and for the past year, she had been wrong roughly every single time. So, despite the eagerness to find something remarkable, her shock was genuine when she brushed the leaves aside. In a small clearing, no larger than a rock pond, was a black jaguar. She bravely, confidently, froze. As she rubbed the condensation from her glasses, Gemma spotted a small mammal underneath the jaguar&rsquo;s paw. Further rubbing led to further clarity, and she recognized the animal as a golden mole. Both rare and beautiful. A fear rushed in that, if she didn&rsquo;t act soon, the mole would be eaten or crushed under the jaguar&rsquo;s leg. &ldquo;Oh, Bramblerot!&rdquo; she whispered. Half thinking, half not-at-all-thinking, Gemma reached into the brown satchel at her waist and found a small piece of suede. Wrapped tightly inside was her favorite brass bell. It was a dented, old gift from an even older grandma, and Gemma never left it behind when she ventured out. Normally, she reserved for it occasions that required making a lot of noise, but an emergency like this called for something much more risky. Stepping forward stealthily, Gemma used her other hand to free a thin purple ribbon from her hair, turning her pigtails into a pigtail. She pressed the suede against the bell tightly to make sure that it didn&rsquo;t attract any unwanted attention. A few paces ahead, and completely unaware of Gemma, the jaguar lifted his paw up for just a moment then pinned the mole down again. Gemma allowed herself a quick and disapproving scowl then focused on the task at hand. She opened the cloth and tied the ribbon around an opening in the brass bell. Then, with the delicacy of a snowflake on a silk napkin at afternoon tea with the Queen, Gemma tied the other end of the ribbon in another knot. She slid backwards through the leaves and grabbed the closest suitable rock. As the jaguar leaned down with his teeth bared, Gemma tossed it towards the dense jungle to her left. Without a moment to spare, the jaguar lifted his head, and whipped his body around. And that&rsquo;s when he heard a jingle. A strange, suspiciously close, jingle. He whipped back the other way and heard the jingle again, but all he saw was jungle. He tried prowling around the clearing, looking for the source, but again saw only jungle. The jingles came faster, one after the other. The mole looked on in surprise as the frustration grew. Then, in the type of overreaction that jaguars are known for, he leapt into the deep brush next to him, looking for anything to attack. Gemma immediately rushed in to grab the wounded golden mole and quickly hid behind the nearest tree. The jaguar ran back into the clearing and looked around with a vicious stare. As soon as he took another step, the bell, which Gemma had fastened securely to his tail, jingled again. Having lost his target, and plagued by the mysterious jingle, the jaguar picked a direction, almost at random, and charged deep into the dark tropical rainforest. When the jingles finally grew quiet, Gemma laid the golden mole down. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she said, petting its head softly. &ldquo;And he won&rsquo;t be sneaking up on anyone for a while,&rdquo; she added with a smile. The mole wheezed out a tiny giggle then shook out its fur. It looked up at Gemma for a long moment, then scrunched its nose. Without a sound, it dug a hole in the soft earth and dove down. Gemma watched in awe as it worked its way out of sight at impressive speed. She peered down to catch one last glimpse, but its little feet had disappeared in a flurry of dirt and dust. Gemma looked around. She had maybe ten minutes before her parents would try to wake her up and then find her missing. It was time to head back. Besides, she had found more than enough adventure for one day. Best for her to leave some for the other young explorers out there. Carefully listening for the jingle of her favorite bell, Gemma weaved through the thick brush until it loosened and gave way to the path that she had personally made, stomp by stomp, over the better part of a year. She was almost to the hut when a small patch of dirt a few steps ahead of her started to move and shake. Approaching slowly, she leaned down and saw the furry face of the golden mole pop up to greet her. It scurried out of its hole and looked Gemma up and down. Gemma waved hello instinctively, as a matter of manners, and with no idea what else to do. The mole reached into the dirt, pulling out an instrument that Gemma had seen many times before. It was a dark blue compass, set on a weathered chain. Gemma grabbed it with two curious hands, turning it over and around to inspect. The compass itself was older than her bell, she imagined, and built with much greater care. Then she reminded herself that her bell was now a jaguar accessory, and no longer hers at all. By the time she was done thinking, the mole had hopped back down its hole, leaving the compass behind. Gemma decided then and there that golden moles were strange creatures with strange habits. It&rsquo;s worth noting, however, that this was an unfair generalization and would only serve her poorly. Later that day, Gemma sat at the kitchen table and watched her parents rush around the hut. The compass was hanging around her neck, unnoticed. She had never seen them so animated as they gathered their belongings and shouted out questions and commands to each other. It was on this day that they had revealed they&rsquo;d be going away on a trip of indeterminate length. Without her. Milo looked up at Gemma and cocked his head to the side. She patted her shoulder, the signal that it was okay for him to climb up and sit. Deftly, he swung up her torso and rested. Most times he would wrap only his tail around her neck, but today was different. He hugged her whole head with every limb he had. &ldquo;Gemma,&rdquo; said her Mom. &ldquo;Come and take a walk with me to the waterfall. I have something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>",2,stories/images/default.jpg,"1. GOLDEN Gemma was only five minutes away from her parents’ hut, but the jungle had already taken on a different personality.

3,The Atrocious Fairytale,Daniel Errico,https://youtu.be/Vh95A4iIV2U,"<p>I must warn you&hellip; this book is ATROCIOUS! The cover has mud all over it, and one of the pages has sprung a leak. Even some of the order are in the wrong words. It is the worst of the worst, so don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you&hellip; Our story begins with an atrocious King, None of his laws ever made any sense. &ldquo;Tuesday?&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;There is no such day, and I&rsquo;ll hear no more of it as long as I am king.&rdquo; From that day on in the kingdom, Monday was followed by second Monday or first Wednesday. His daughter was an atrocious Princess. She was not fancy and polite like most princesses, despite the princess lessons she took each day. She never brushed her hair. She smelled of month- old bananas, and she was very devious. She even set traps throughout this story. [Illustrations throughout the story will indicate the Princess&rsquo; traps] One day the Princess went missing. In her place there was a note that read: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken the Princess. You me catch never will.&rdquo; After reading the note twice to understand it, the King commanded the greatest hero in the land to find his daughter. The greatest hero in the land happened to be an atrocious hero. He was often too frightened to leave his home, and he was also scared by butterflies. However, he had once defeated two caterpillars and a moth in a single battle, and this made him the greatest of all the heroes in the land. The hero rode to the castle of the meanest villain in the kingdom, but the villain, too was atrocious. He brought flowers to old ladies whenever he could. And out of the kindness of his heart, he once built a house for someone who needed it. [The hero] The hero stormed the gate and charged into the dungeon of the villain&rsquo;s castle. &ldquo;Surrender the Princess!&rdquo; he yelled while shaking in his armor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a Princess,&rdquo; said the villain, &ldquo;I use this dungeon to bake cookies, but watch your step because there&rsquo;s a leak down here.&rdquo; [An example of a Princess trap with words floating in water.] The hero was more confused than usual. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t take the Princess, then who did?&rdquo; asked the hero. &ldquo;We should go ask the dragon what he thinks.&rdquo; Mind you, this was an atrocious dragon. He was known for being tidy and wise, not fierce and ferocious like dragons are supposed to be. He brushed his teeth every night, and when he breathed, there was no fire, just minty freshness. The dragon was very upset when they found him. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s stolen my gold, and they left this note in its place!&rdquo; he cried. It read: &ldquo;Your gold is with the Princess! Mine now is it!&rdquo; &ldquo;This is odd,&rdquo; said the hero. &ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; said the villain. &ldquo;Frmph,&rdquo; said the dragon who always flossed his teeth when he was upset. &ldquo;Perhaps the Queen knows something.&rdquo; The Queen was running around the castle when they arrived. She, actually, was not so atrocious (for it was she who hired the royal scribe who wrote this very book). &ldquo;My treasures are missing&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;My books and jewels, and my fine silk.&rdquo; &ldquo;Someone has taken them and left this atrocious note.&rdquo; It read: &ldquo;Your treasure is mine! Do not trying to bother find it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whoever has stolen your treasure has the Princess,&rdquo; said the hero. &ldquo;Here are some flowers,&rdquo; said the villain. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the dragon, &ldquo;there are footprints of dirt on the floor.&rdquo; They followed the footprints all the way up to the tallest tower in the tallest part of the castle. When they looked inside they found all the gold, books, jewels, and silk, covered in dirt. And sitting on a throne on top of the pile, was the Princess. &ldquo;Why did you steal these things and make us look for you?&rdquo; asked the Queen. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to go to my writing lessons!&rdquo; said the Princess, &ldquo;Who needs writing?&rdquo; &ldquo;You do,&rdquo; said the Queen. The villain, knight, and dragon all nodded in agreement. The Queen made the Princess return what she had stolen and apologize. From that day on, the King made the Princess go to her lessons six days a week. She was an atrocious student when they began, but she got better each day. It took the dragon hours to brush all the dirt off his coins. The villain developed a taste for soggy cookies, and he baked them all the time. The hero decided it was finally time to battle a butterfly&hellip; and he lost. As for the Queen, she insisted that the entire atrocious tale be written inside of one of her muddy books. I warned you this book was atrocious, and now it is over! Perhaps, one day you could write a better one&hellip;</p>",1,stories/images/Atrocious.jpg,"I must warn you… this book is ATROCIOUS!

4,The Great Hill,Daniel Errico,https://youtu.be/0BSAAaM9Gw8,"<p>Before time was time, there was a Great Hill. And on the Great Hill there lived the Yolks. The Yolks spent their entire lives climbing the Great Hill, trying to reach the top. Some Yolks climbed fast. Some Yolks climbed slowly. One Yolk in particular was a very slow climber. He was different than the rest of the Yolks. When he climbed, all the other Yolks passed him. It was hard for him to watch them pass by. He felt like the worst climber in the world. Some Yolks made fun of him as they passed. Others didn&rsquo;t. Some Yolks wanted to help him climb but he didn&rsquo;t let them. It was hard for him to climb. It was even harder when it rained because the ground got slippery. Sometimes it seemed like it was only raining on him. But it wasn&rsquo;t. There were times when he felt like he wasn&rsquo;t moving at all. But he was. Then one day he met another Yolk who climbed even slower than he did. He helped the slower Yolk climb. &ldquo;Thank You,&rdquo; said the slower Yolk. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Welcome,&rdquo; said the slow Yolk, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be of much help to anyone else since I climb so slowly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Slowly?&rdquo; asked the slower Yolk. &ldquo;Well yes. I watch other Yolks pass me all the time.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not know if you are slow or fast, but I do know that you helped me, and that you are still climbing.&rdquo; The slow Yolk said goodbye to the slower Yolk, and kept climbing. &ldquo;Still climbing,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo; And he smiled. So the Yolk kept climbing. He climbed when it was nice out, he climbed when it rained, and he even climbed when it snowed. As he kept climbing he got better and better. Sometimes he would pass other Yolks and sometimes they would pass him. He had stopped paying attention. He also noticed that some Yolks were no longer climbing. When a yolk stops climbing it stays where it is. Some Yolks stop climbing because they are happy with how far they have gone. Others stop climbing because they don&rsquo;t want to climb anymore. The Yolks that had stopped climbing did not like to be passed, and they made it harder to get by. But the Yolk kept climbing, right over them! There were still times when the Yolk thought he was climbing an impossible hill, but he kept climbing. Always, always, climbing. Do you think he made the top?</p>",1,stories/images/The_great_hill.jpg,"Before time was time, there was a Great Hill. And on the Great Hill there lived the Yolks.

9,The Story of Yes and No,Daniel Errico,https://www.freechildrenstories.com/the-story-of-yes-and-no-1,"<p><span style=""color:#3300cc""><strong>B</strong></span>efore words were words, a boy named Yes lived in a small village in a small kingdom. Yes was good at everything. He was the best, smartest and most liked person in his village. Yes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was not much good at anything himself. Whenever the villagers asked No for help, he refused because he didn&rsquo;t like people very much. Whenever someone asked Yes for a favor, he would gladly help, and he secretly didn&rsquo;t mind the fact that it irritated No when he did.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/media/uploads/2021/02/04/yn1.jpeg"" style=""height:285px; width:450px"" /></p>

<p><span style=""color:#3300cc""><strong>O</strong></span>ne day Yes and No&rsquo;s father, Okay went on a long journey and he left his two sons in charge of all the animals. Yes took good care of the great guck, and the icks, and the three-toed yock. [Keep in mind, my dear friend, that the guck, ick, and three-toed yock were very old animals, so you might know them by different names today.] No didn&rsquo;t want to be bothered with the boring tasks involved with taking care of the animals. So instead of helping his brother, No went down to the lake and threw rocks into the water.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/media/uploads/2021/02/04/yn2.jpeg"" style=""height:330px; width:450px"" /></p>

<p><span style=""color:#3300cc""><strong>A</strong></span> few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to watch the three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat. Instead of doing what Yes asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and forgot about the yock.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/media/uploads/2021/02/04/yn3.jpeg"" style=""height:359px; width:450px"" /></p>

<p><strong><span style=""background-color:#3300cc"">I</span></strong>t just so happened that the King had a personal road nearby, and he traveled on it often. So often, that when the three-toed yock wandered onto the road, the King&rsquo;s carriage was passing by and had to swerve to avoid hitting it.&nbsp;The King was thrown from the carriage and fell to the ground and hurt himself.</p>

<p>The King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been allowed on his road and asked all the villagers for an explanation. Yes was always honest, so he told the King the entire story.</p>

<p>The King thought for a moment, and then he came up with an idea that he was quite happy with. Yes and No were to work in the castle as his personal assistants as punishment for what was later referred to as the worst three-toed yock and carriage accident in the Kingdom&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/media/uploads/2021/02/04/yn4.jpeg"" style=""height:285px; width:450px"" /></p>

<p><span style=""color:#3300cc""><strong>T</strong></span>he King needed help with many things around the castle because a King cannot be bothered with the daily tasks involved with running a Kingdom. However, soon after his decision about the two brothers, the King realized that only Yes would be of any use to him as a servant. Whenever the King asked No to bring him anything, it would get thrown away, broken, or eaten, without exception. The King was quite sure that No was the worst servant in the entire world.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""/media/uploads/2021/02/04/yn5.jpeg"" style=""height:330px; width:450px"" /></p>

<p><span style=""color:#3300cc""><strong>T</strong></span>he brothers&rsquo; most important task was to help pick the food for a grand party that the King was throwing later that night. Cooks from all over the Kingdom lined up at the castle&rsquo;s gate to offer the King their food for the party. Of course, the King could not go and grab the food himself, so he asked Yes and No to do it for him.</p>

<p>The first cook came up the gate and yelled to the Gatekeeper, &ldquo;I bring my delicious ugberry pie for the King&rsquo;s banquet!&rdquo; The King heard this and thought that ugberry pie would be perfect for such an event (and he would love to eat the leftovers). He didn&rsquo;t want anything to happen to the ugberry pie, so he yelled &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; and then asked him to go fetch it.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#3300cc""><strong>T</strong></span>he next cook stepped up to the gate. &ldquo;I offer the King grukie soup!&rdquo; he said. The King didn&rsquo;t like grukie soup very much and he knew just how to get rid of it. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he yelled and then sent No out to retrieve the soup. No dropped the soup before the King could even smell it.</p>

If he did not, everyone would hear a loud &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; and the dish would be destroyed moments later by a servant with a very bad attitude. Pretty soon this started catching on around the Kingdom, for if a King does something, his loyal subjects are never far behind. If they didn&rsquo;t want a second scoop of potatoes, they would say &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And if they liked what someone was offering, they would say, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And ever since that day in a small village in a small kingdom, Yes has meant Yes, and No has meant No.</p>

Yes was good at everything. He was the best, smartest and most liked person in his village. Yes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was not much good at anything himself. Whenever the villagers asked No for help, he refused because he didn’t like people very much. Whenever someone asked Yes for a favor, he would gladly help, and he secretly didn’t mind the fact that it irritated No when he did.",,2021-02-02

11,It Could Happen...,Carol Moore,http://www.magickeys.com/books/happen/index.html,"<p><span style=""color:#cc0000""><strong>O</strong></span>ne day, overnight, the world turned violet. Just about everything turned violet from the sky and ocean and mountains to the trees and animals and people and from the tallest skyscrapers to the tiniest ant. People sat around looking at one another wondering if they were dreaming. But nobody woke up and things stayed violet, all except for a single Blue Jay who hadn&#39;t changed color and stayed the brightest blue.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>P</strong></span>eople were shocked. Some were afraid and some were amazed and a few thought it funny, because along with everyone else, the President was very violet. Whole families were violet as were teachers, movie stars, doctors, nurses, gas station attendants, the Queen of England, the President of Mozambique, taxi-drivers, everybody. They went from place to place in their violet cars and buses and rode violet bikes and sat on violet furniture and ate violet food. Even Hershey&#39;s candy bars had turned all violet as had Skittles and M&amp;M&#39;s. Girls generally thought this yucky, but some boys thought it was pretty neat.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>T</strong></span>he smartest scientists in the world gathered to figure it out. Was something wrong with people&#39;s eyes or was it a trick of nature? They did studies and tests and analyzed and evaluated and debated and wrote article after article, but couldn&#39;t explain it.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>A</strong></span>nd no longer could people say they felt &quot;blue&quot; or were &quot;green&quot; with envy or had a &quot;green&quot; thumb. So what they said and how they said it began to change. Some people said violet was now the most important color in the world because it was everywhere. Others said that violet had no importance at all because there was too much of it. They discussed and argued, joined clubs, held debates, wrote books, and produced movies all about the issue of the importance or unimportance of the color violet.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>T</strong></span>he color of the Blue Jay became a big issue because he had such a little bit of blue and the world had such a whole lot of violet. People argued about the importance of that. Some said the Blue Jay must be a very special bird or maybe not a bird at all because he alone had kept his true color. Others said this was silly, that the Blue Jay ate bird seed and drank water and fluffed his feathers and that other than his special color he was still just a bird.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>I</strong></span>t was exactly one year to the day after the world had turned violet that people awoke to find the world had turned yellow. All except the Blue Jay.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>I</strong></span>n some ways a yellow world isn&#39;t any different than a violet world. People simply said yellow instead of violet when they talked about things. Only now the Blue Jay was more important than ever because he alone had stayed the color blue and people argued about what that meant. They lined up for miles just to take a look at him.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>F</strong></span>or the next two years, exactly on the day the world had turned violet and then yellow, it turned new colors: first orange and then pink. Still the Blue Jay stayed blue, causing ever greater disagreement -- until in the fifth year the whole world turned blue.</p>

<p><span style=""color:#c0392b""><strong>T</strong></span>he first thing people asked was what about the Blue Jay. Had he stayed blue? Yes, he was still the same color. No longer were there two colors in the world, but just one -- the color blue. And because the Blue Jay was a color like everybody and everything else people began to lose interest.</p>
